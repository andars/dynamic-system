      <h2> Explanation </h2>
      <p>

        This page provides a visualization for dynamical systems (systems that
        are described by differential equations). It is capable of working with
        one dimensional systems of first or second order. While working only
        with one dimensional systems is a limitation, it nonetheless allows for
        plenty of freedom to explore and makes visualizations significantly
        simpler.

      </p>

      <p>
        There are some rather large and possibly intimidating equations below.
        If you aren't familiar with differential equations, get what you can
        out of them and move on. Hopefully the text explains what is going on
        well enough that you can do without the equations.

      </p>
      <h3> Overview </h3>
      <p>

        The visualization shows three different representations of the same
        system. The second and third are probably familiar to you, but the
        first may not be. I will go over the representations in reverse order.

      </p>
      <p>

        The third shows a plot of the variable $x$ over time. This is a fairly
        standard representation of a one dimensional system. For the default
        system, it should display a damped sinusoid.

      </p>
      <p>

        The second shows the current position of the particle (or the current
        value of the variable, if we aren't dealing with a mechanical system).
        This is the same information as in the third representation, but it only
        displays the value at the current instant.

      </p>
      <p>

        The first is a bit stranger. The horizontal axis is the velocity of the
        particle (again, doesn't have to be a particle, so just rate of change)
        and the vertical axis is the value of the variable. Together, they form
        what is called a <em> phase portrait</em>. This type of diagram shows
        the complete state of the system as a function of time. Time appears
        only implicitly as the path is traced out; it doesn't appear on either
        axis. Note that for the default system (and all mechanical systems) the
        speed of the trace moving vertically along the position axis is equal
        to the distance away from the y-axis (the velocity). This is expected,
        because the velocity is just the directed speed of the particle.

      <p>


      </p>

      <h3> The Harmonic Oscillator </h3>
      <p>
        Another quick note: $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is exactly the same as $x'(t)$, and
        I mix the two notations freely in the below. Both refer to the rate
        of change of the variable, $x$ in this case.

      </p>
      <p>

        The default system is a damped harmonic oscillator. This type of system
        shows up often in physics, whether as a spring-mass system or an RLC
        circuit. The governing differential equation of this system is

        \[ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dx}{dt} + k x = F(t), \]

        where $F(t)$ is an applied external force. In the following, I will
        assume $m = 1$ and $F(t) = 0$.

      </p>
      <p>

        In order to numerically solve this system, we decompose it into two
        first order differential equations. This is a neat trick that generalizes
        to decompose any $n$th-order differential equations into $n$ first order
        equations. I feel that this representation is actually superior to the
        second order equation because it allows more intuition than the above
        equation, especially for mechanical systems. When deriving the governing
        equation, however, it is often easier to use the single second order
        ODE.

      </p>
      <p>

      The idea is to introduce an auxiliary variable $v(t) = x'(t)$. Using the
      original equation, we can now form two equations:

      \[ \frac{dx}{dt} = v.\]
      \[ \frac{dv}{dt} = -\gamma v - k x \]

      What do these equations mean? The first one is more simple that it appears,
      it is just saying that the rate of change of position, $x(t)$, is equal
      to the velocity, $v(t)$. That is just the definition of velocity.

      </p>

      <p>

      How about the second equation? $v'(t)$ is the acceleration, so it says
      that the force (by $F = ma$ with $m=1$) on the particle is opposing
      the motion (the negative signs) and is proportional to both the velocity
      and the position. The portion $-k x$ is a <em> restoring force</em>
      because it pushes the particle back toward position zero. The portion $-
      \gamma v$ is a <em> damping force</em> because it resists the motion of
      the particle and tends to slow the particle to a halt.

      </p>
      <p>

      Now we are prepared to start playing around with the visualization above.
      Try moving the sliders for the damping and spring constant and see what
      happens.

      </p>
      <p>

      You can also try modifying the initial values of the system using the
      two boxes on the right hand side and restarting.

      </p>
      <p>
      Note that the center text fields for $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dv}{dt}$
      are the two first order equations above transcribed into javascript code.
      </p>

      <h3> Other Systems </h3>
      <p>

      Now that we have seen what each of the parameters of the visualization
      are, we are ready to start looking at systems with entirely different
      behaviour, not just variations on the harmonic oscillator.

      </p>
      <p>

      If you are familiar with dynamical systems, go ahead and make some
      modifications to the derivatives in the center text fields. If the field
      is highlighted in red, it means that you have an error in your
      expression, possibly a missing semicolon at the end.  The variables
      <code> x </code> and <code> v </code> represent your variable and its
      rate of change. In addition <code> gamma </code> and <code> k </code> are
      the variables controlled by the sliders on the left. They aren't
      mandatory, and you can just directly enter constants as well, like this:
      <code> return -5*v - 14*x; </code>

      </p>
      <p>

      If you aren't familiar with dynamical systems, I'll provide some
      possibilities that you may like to try. Under each heading below, there
      are expressions for the two derivatives. Copy and paste should work, or
      you can just type them in yourself. The visualization will probably
      go weird while you are editing, so hit restart when you are ready.

      </p>

      <h4> Exponential Growth
      <a class='system' href='#dx=return%20x%2Fgamma%3B&dv=return%200%3B&x0=10&gamma=4'>
        [activate]</a>
      </h4>


      <p>
      $\frac{dx}{dt}$: <code> return x/gamma; </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      $\frac{dv}{dt}$: <code> return 0; </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Initial x value: <code> 10 </code>
      </p>
      <p>
      This is actually a first order system, since we are ignoring the second
      derivative entirely. As a result, the phase portrait is pretty boring,
      but the second and third representations work well.

      <p>
      <p/>

      This will give you an exponential curve in the third plot, and the second
      plot will show the block moving upwards slowly at first but increasing in
      speed.

      <p>
      <p/>
      Because of the exponential nature of this system, the visualization is
      short-lived. The variables will all be off the charts after just a few
      seconds.

      </p>

      <p>

      Exponential growth is used to model all kinds of phenomena in many different
      fields. For example, it is a fairly good model for:
      <ul>
        <li> Human population growth </li>
        <li> Continuous compound interest. This never actually happens, since
        your interest is only compounded at finite intervals, i.e. yearly, but
        the idea is the same </li>
        <li> Number of transistors on a chip </li>
        <li> Chain reactions of nuclear fission, as occurs when nuclear weapons detonate</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h4> Logistic Growth
        <a class='system' href='#dx=return%20gamma*x*(1-x%2F(5*k%2B1))%3B&dv=return%200%3B&x0=25&k=40&gamma=2&x0=2'>
          [activate]</a>
      </h4>

      <p>
      $\frac{dx}{dt}$: <code> return gamma*x*(1-x/(5*k+1)); </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      $\frac{dv}{dt}$: <code> return 0; </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Initial x value: <code> 0 to 50 </code>
      </p>

      <p>

      Another first order system. While exponential growth is a good model for
      many things over relatively short timescales, it has the unfortunate
      problem that it quickly predicts values going to infinity. The physical
      world, however, doesn't tend to like infinities. As some examples,
      population growth (of any population) is limited by food supply and other
      factors and chemical reactions are limited by concentrations of the
      reactants.

      </p>
      <p>

      In these cases, logistic growth is a better model. At the beginning it
      exhibits near exponential growth, but the value levels off as it approaches
      the system's <em> carrying capacity</em>. In the above expression,
      <code> gamma </code> represents the growth rate of the system, and
      <code> k </code> represents the carrying capacity of the system.

      </p>
      <p>
      Logistic growth is used to model systems such as:
      <ul>
        <li> More realistic population growth</li>
        <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations'> Adoption of a new technology</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_(sociology)"> Tipping points of various kinds</a></li>
        <li> Tumor growth </li>
      </ul>
      In addition, while the differential equation is not directly used, the
      logistic function (the plot on the far right) has applications in neural
      networks as an activation function and in machine learning (see
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression'> logistic regression</a>).
      </p>
      <p>

      Play around with the parameters to see their effects. If you are feeling
      Malthusian, increase the carrying capacity initially and then quickly
      decrease it. This will demonstrate a <a
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe'> Malthusian
        catastrophe</a>.

      </p>

      <h4> Van der Pol oscillator
      <a class='system' href='#dx=return%20v%3B&dv=return%20gamma%2F2*(1-x*x%2F2500)*v%20-%20k%2F10*x%3B&x0=150&gamma=2.8&k=17'>
        [activate]</a>
      </h4>

      <p>
      $\frac{dx}{dt}$: <code> return v; </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      $\frac{dv}{dt}$: <code> return gamma/2*(1-x*x/2500)*v - k/10*x; </code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Initial x value: <code> 100 to 200 </code>
      </p>

      <p>

      A more complex and interesting oscillator than the harmonic oscillator
      described above. By comparing this equation to that of the damped
      harmonic oscillator, we can see that the restoring force term is identical,
      but the damping is nonlinearly dependent on $x$.

      </p>
      <p>

      Here, <code> gamma </code> represents the damping coefficient, and
      <code> k </code> represents the restoring coefficient, just like in
      the harmonic oscillator system.

      </p>
      <p>

      This oscillator exhibits interesting <em> limit cycles</em>, which are
      cyclic trajectories in phase space that the system tends towards.

      </p>
      <p>

      The Van der Pol oscillator is a good model for <a
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator'> relaxation
        oscillators</a>, which are widely used as an oscillator in applications
      where an accurate frequency is not required and the waveform can be a bit
      strange. Think of this when you turn your windshield wipers on in the rain
      or watch blinking turn signals almost synchronize at red lights.

      <h3> Implementation Notes </h3>
      <p>

      I have implemented three numerical solvers: Euler, Improved Euler, and
      RK4. The visualization defaults to using Improved Euler, a second order
      iterative method which has good enough performance for visualizing most
      things.

      </p>
      <p>

      If you would like to switch integrators, you can open the web console and
      type <code> integrator = rk4; </code> or <code> integrator = euler;
      </code> Pretty much the only reason to use the Euler method is to see how
      bad it is, but RK4 may actually be useful to you because of its increased
      accuracy.

      </p>
      <p>

      I haven't gotten around to implementing a fixed time step yet, so the
      simulation speed is frame rate dependent and if your frame rate drops
      the error will increase.
